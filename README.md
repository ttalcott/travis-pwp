My personal website project.

## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work here. The clarity with which you define your Purpose, Audience, Goals, Persona, and User Stories is thoughtful and very well defined. Your Use Case is actually a list of very well done User Stories. What we were actually looking for here was a paragraph outlining WHY, WHERE, WHEN, and with WHAT (technology) your Persona will be using the site. I find your User Stories to be very consice, clear, specific, and valuable here though.

Since Retina display devices are specifically mentioned in your Persona, I would highly recommend loading specific images for high resolution displays via CSS media queries. Especially if you plan on featuring prominent images in your design. We typically don't get around to covering this in lecture, but check the following tutorial out, and the bridge will be happy to assist!

Really great work here - you have a great foundation upon which to begin your design phase. Your HTML looks great, and your directory structure is perfect. Nice work - I'm looking forward to seeing your project take shape. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
